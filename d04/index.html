		<h1>It's mad hot in here</h1>
		<p>
		The room was so hot that everyone fell asleep. Good thing at least one of the windows could be opened. For some odd reason, another window had a sign that said "do not open this window." Man, was that stupid. Everyone agreed that it was foolish to prevent the people from opening the window in the event of a hot room.
